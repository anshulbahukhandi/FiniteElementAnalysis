# FiniteElementAnalysis
This code was part of our coursework (CEE 526 Finite Element Analysis) at Arizona state university
All the library file belongs to our professor Mr. S.D Rajan and uploaded here by his permission.
Please take his/my permission before copying/using/modifying any part of the program anywhere.

Code was completed by me using Mr. Rajan's library files and skeleton code.

What this code does?

- Finite Element analysis is a technique of breaking an object into smaller elements(Numerically, NOT Physically) and approximating the solution.
- Finer the object is broken better and more close to accurate will be the solution. But more will be the computation.
- This program does the Finite Element Analysis of 2D objects.
- It takes the geometry of the 2D object by parsing the input text file . Analysis the input and generates the results in output test file.
